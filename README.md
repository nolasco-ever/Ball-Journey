# Ball-Journey
Ball's Journey is a 2D platformer where the player is, well, a ball! The goal of the game is to reach the green platform at the end of each stage. There are 5 stages that become more and more difficult as you go!<br>

Using C# in Unity, this was the first game I ever created. I made this completely from scratch and all on my own. It's a very basic game with really only two shapes: rectangles and a circle. The controls are also very simple being only left arrow to move left, right arrow to move right, and space key to jump. As the player progresses through the 5 stages, there are obstacles that obstruct your path to the green platform and they become more and more difficult.
